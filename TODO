- [ ] Events & Opportunities
	This is a big feature. Minor events can happen more often, and have minor effects. Major events happen more rarely and have major effects. An event effect should be a factor in several places such as:
	- interest rate calculation (hyperinflation causes interest rates to go up, depression causes interest rates to go down)
	- probability for getting loan from bank (poor economy makes banks more tight with lending, and good economy makes banks more open to lending)
	- decreased or increased max loan amounts the bank is willing to lend
	- quality and amount of tenant applications (poor economy or city planning makes quality of area go down, attracting more poor quality tenants who can't afford to live elsewhere)
	- quality of an area or property type (business can begin to boom in an area, causing investments to be more lucrative in that area)

	The system should be modular such that it's easy to write in new events, their probabilities, their durations and their effects. A major event should also be able to have minor events attached to it. For example, civil unrest will decrease economy factors, which leads to citizens causing property damage and theft.

	There should also be a notice somewhere in the main view, for example a clickable banner, which brings up a modal with more information about the current event, and possible minor events related to it.

	We can leverage the modal system for creating choices related to events. The choices will decide how much the events will impact the player.

	There should also be a new feature in the banking system to buy interest rate protection for the loans the player has taken. This will cap the interest rates at a percentage chosen by player. Smaller cap will be more expensive per month.
